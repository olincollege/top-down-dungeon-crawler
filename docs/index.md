# Sandman's Adventure
## Mika Gazit, Ivy Mahncke, Charlie Mawn


### The Big Idea:
This game is a top down adventure game where the player will explore maps, pick up items, and interact with npc's. The goal of this project was not only to create a fun game by the end, but also for us to explore, experiment with, and understand the intricacies of pygame, sprites, tilesets, and so much more.
