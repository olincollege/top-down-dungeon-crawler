# Sandman's Adventure

#### [Our Github Page](https://github.com/olincollege/top-down-dungeon-crawler)


### The Big Idea
This game is a top down adventure game where the player will explore maps, pick up items, and interact with npc's. The goal of this project was not only to create a fun game by the end, but also for us to explore, experiment with, and understand the intricacies of pygame, sprites, tilesets, and so much more. 

### Unique Features
This game conatains lots of interesting maps, npc, and items that all connect in some way. There are plently of small 'easter eggs' hidden around the maps that we added for fun.

Here is an image of one of our maps. Using the tilesets and sprite assets provided by the sources above, we put together a total 7 maps, each with intricate detail. We use the [Tiled Map Editor](https://thorbjorn.itch.io/tiled)

### How to Play
In order to download the game, navigate to our github page (linked above), then follow the instructions in the README.md file to download, and run. 

Throughout the map, there are many npc's waiting to be interacted with. When talked to, they provide the player with a quest, and when completed, the npc will be satisfied. The final goal of the game is to navigate the whole map, interact with every npc, and find all the items that the npc's desire. Once all the npc's are satisfied, you win!
