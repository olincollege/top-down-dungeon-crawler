"""
File to test world_manager.py

We will not be testing any functions in world_manager.py for the
following reasons:

init: we are not testing initialization functions
get_room: getter that returns a Room object, which is property-like
and therefore pointless to test.
get_world_npcs: we would have to define too much of a world state to test
this function.
